# U.S. Census Bureau App

This program is a Streamlit app that uses Python libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, and Plotly Express to display a dashboard with interactive visualizations of yearly birth data by country and continent. The data is loaded from a CSV file named "Yearly Births by Country.csv" generated from API requests to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Worldwide Overview: displays a line plot of the yearly births for all countries combined.
Continent: displays a line plot of the yearly births for each continent and allows you to drill down into specific countries within the continent. If you select one or more countries, you can see an animated choropleth map of the yearly births by country.
Country: allows you to select one or more countries and a time range to see their yearly births in a line plot.
Example
