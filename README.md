# U.S. Census Bureau - Interactive Dashboard

As part of a selft-taught training, I wanted to combine API, data analysis and web app deployment into this project.

What does the app do ?

First of all, using Python, data from retrieved from a U.S. Census Bureau API to get yearly births of all countries referenced in the API.

Then, on the web app itself, the user can visually explore data by continent or countries through various graphs.
