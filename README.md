# U.S. Census Bureau - Interactive Dashboard

As part of a selft-taught training, I wanted to combine API, data analysis and web app deployment into a project.

What does the app do ?

Upon user selection of a country and time range, the app retrieves data from a U.S. Census Bureau API, wrangles data and displays metrics, an interactive table and a downloadable visualization.
